 *  You need to do a minimal job to successfully integrate Firebase into your React application.
 *  1. Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console.
 * 2. Add a web app to your Firebase project.
 * 3. Copy the Firebase configuration object from the Firebase console.
 * 4. Go to firebase/firebase.init.js file, there you will find firebaseConfig object using env variables. (don't need to change anything)
 * 5. You will find a .evn.local file in the root directory. Open it and paste your Firebase configuration values there.
 * 7. You are all set to use Firebase in your React application.
